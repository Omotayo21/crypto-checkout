## ✨ Features

### Step 1: Bank Details
- ✅ Custom dropdown for bank selection
- ✅ Account number input (10-digit validation)
- ✅ Auto-populated account name after entering valid account number
- ✅ Read-only account name display
- ✅ Real-time validation with error messages

### Step 2: Contact Details
- ✅ Email input with format validation
- ✅ Phone number input with country code selector
- ✅ Nigerian flag emoji with +234 code
- ✅ Dropdown for multiple country codes
- ✅ Real-time validation

### General Features
- ✅ Fully responsive (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- ✅ Smooth step-by-step navigation
- ✅ Back button to return to previous step
- ✅ Clean, modern UI matching Figma design
- ✅ Accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- ✅ TypeScript for type safety
- ✅ Form state management
- ✅ Loading simulation for account name lookup

## 🎨 Design Implementation

The design closely follows the provided Figma mockups with:
- Rounded pill-shaped input fields
- Teal/dark green primary color (#013941)
- Clean white background with subtle shadows
- Proper spacing and typography
- Responsive layout that adapts to all screen sizes

## 🧪 Testing the Form

### Test Data

**Valid Account Number**: Enter any 10-digit number (e.g., `1234567890`)
- The account name "ODUTUGA GBEKE" will auto-populate after 0.5s



### Validation Rules

- Bank must be selected
- Account number must be exactly 10 digits
- Account name must be populated (happens automatically with valid account number)
- Email must be in valid format (example@domain.com)
- Phone number must be at least 10 digits

## 📝 Assumptions & Trade-offs

### Assumptions Made:
1. **Account Name Lookup**: Simulated with a 500ms delay and mock data. In production, this would call a real banking API.
2. **Bank List**: Used a static list of popular Nigerian banks. In production, this would be fetched from an API.
3. **Country Codes**: Limited to 4 countries for demo purposes. Production would include all countries.
4. **Form Submission**: Currently logs to console and shows alert. Would integrate with backend API in production.

### Trade-offs:
1. **State Management**: Used React's built-in `useState` instead of Redux/Zustand for simplicity, as the form state is self-contained.
2. **Validation**: Implemented custom validation instead of using libraries like Yup or Zod to keep dependencies minimal.
3. **Component Structure**: Kept everything in one component for this assessment. In production, would split into smaller, reusable components.
4. **Mobile Optimization**: Prioritized clean design over complex mobile interactions (like native-style bottom sheets for dropdowns).



## 💡 Future Enhancements

If given more time, I would add:
- [ ] Integration with real banking APIs
- [ ] More comprehensive form validation library
- [ ] Animation library (Framer Motion) for smoother transitions
- [ ] Progress indicator showing step 1 of 2
- [ ] Local storage to persist form data
- [ ] Additional form fields based on requirements
- [ ] Dark mode support
